# Hello, world!
### All ways that I could think about how to print "Hello, world!"

<br/>

Start with Python first!

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
Easy syntax, right?

<br/>

Now, let's go with C, Python's father!
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```
