# Hello, world!
### All ways that I could think about how to print "Hello, world!"

<br/>

Start with Python first!
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
Easy syntax, right?

<br/>

What about Python's rival, Golang

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
It is compiled language, so a bit of complex

<br/>

Now, let's go with C, Python's father!
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```

<br/>

How about C++, another kid of C:)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
