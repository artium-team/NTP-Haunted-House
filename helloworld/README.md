# Hello, world!
### All ways that I could think about how to print "Hello, world!"

<br/>

Let's start with something old, Fortran

```fortran
program helloworld
    print *, "Hello World"
end program helloworld
```

<br/>

Next, Python
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
Easy syntax, right?

<br/>

What about Python's rival, Golang

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
It is compiled language, so a bit of complex

<br/>

Now, let's go with C, Python's father!
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```

<br/>

How about C++, another kid of C:)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```

<br/>

All things above are complex, now go with somethings easy!

Hmmm! Oh! Javascript, web developers' enemy
```js
console.log("Hello World");
```
What a !short and !uncomplicated thing

<br/>

And here is Typescript, Javascript sibling:)

```ts
console.log 'Hello World'
```
